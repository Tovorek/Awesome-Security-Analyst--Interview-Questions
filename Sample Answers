      2) What Methods do you use to know Keep updated about emerging threats.

ans-
# Basic emerging threats
1) AI Enabled adversarial attacks.  - Adversasries will be more dependent on AI enabled tools to craft their exploits.

2) Targeted Attacks that are enhanced by IOT devices  - This is not new thing considering stuxnet, but with a plethora of IOT devices that we depend today, it can also be categorized as an emerging threat.

3) Social Engineering - It remains a constant, 2023 alone over 75% of the attacks initited with a phishing email that lead to an employee disclosing his/her credentials.

4) Cloud vulnerabilities - One might think the cloud would become more secure over time, but in fact, the opposite is true: IBM reports that cloud vulnerabilities have increased 150% in the last five years. Verizon’s DBIR found that over 90% of the 29,000 breaches analyzed in the report were caused by web app breaches. 
According to Gartner, cloud security is currently the fastest-growing cybersecurity market segment, with a 41% increase from $595 million in 2020 to $841 million in 2021.

5) Third-party risk exposure - Cybercriminals can get around security systems by hacking less-protected networks belonging to third parties that have privileged access to the hacker’s primary target.


# What Methods do you use to know Keep updated about emerging threats.

1) Follow security experts - Mikko Hypponen, Brian Krebs, Jack Rhysider
2) Read Security News, blogs and podcasts - HThe Hacker News, Krebs on Security, Dark Reading, CSO Online, and ZDNet Security, security weekly, Darknet Diaries
3) Discuss with friends - All my friends are in the security domain.
4) Threat intelligence feeds - FBI InfraGuard and AT&T Alien Labs Open Threat Exchange provide real-time information on emerging threats and trends.

2) Can you walk me through economics of cyber security?

ans: There are many factors to be considered when talking about the economics of cybersecurity. Some of those factors include;

     1) Misaligned incentives: These happen when the stakeholders do not recieve the necessary amount of incentives as they deserve, which can lead to gaps in security hardening attempts.
     2) Information asymmetries: When a set of people have more information about their security posture than other. Example; a company has more idea about its security posture than its customers and stakeholders.
     3) Externalities: Externalities are explained as the actions of one party that can impact people who are not part of the transactions. Example; data leaks affect users and stakeholders.
     4) Policy solutions: Policy may be used to overcome the economic barriers to cybersecurity. Liability can be assigned in the law, and pressure can be exerted on intermediaries, such as internet service providers, to improve cybersecurity.
     5) Investment decisions: If proper investment decisions for cybersecurity are not made by the board, it can badly affect the company as a whole. Vast majority of the cyberattacks taking place are unsophisticated ones, all due to lack of proper investment for cybersecurity.

3) 3. What parts of the information security should the organisations outsource?

ans: It depends on various factors, like company size, budgetting restrictions,etc. The following is a list of commonly outsourced security requirements;

     1)  Security Auditing & Compliance: External teams from varoius organizations help to provide objective and impartial information about the security posture of an organization. It can also include penetration testing, consulting, vulnerabiliity assessments and compliance audits.
     2) Managed Security Services(MSS): This can include 24/7 monitoring teams like SOC, vulnerability management, Threat Intelligence, etc.
     3) Incident Response and Digital forensics: Companied need not keep experts in this domain on their regular payroll and can outsource to deploy experts on a need basis.
     4) Cybersecurity Awareness & Training: Companies can outsource training teams.
     5) Security as a service (SAAS) vendors.
